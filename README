Game is Rock, Paper, Scissors

Press Nav switch in a direction to move off starting message, and to a waiting screen with a single line.

Pressing nav left selects scissors, nav up for paper, and nav right for rock.

Selections are not locked in until the nav switch is pressed in, and until then choices can be changed between the three options.

The blue LED will light up upon locking in a choice.

Once both players have locked in a choice, the game decides the winner and loser, or draw if both players have selected the same option.

The winning board displays a 'W' for win, and losing board a 'L' for loss.

Pressing R13 button takes you back to idle screen with single line, and waits for another input to start another game.
